# it is the first time, we've created a project with Docker
# first of all we created a Dockerfile and build the initial image
# after that we created a docker-compose.yml and run the container with docker-compose up
# if you want to stop it, docker-compose down
# docker has images, containers and of course docker host
# images => they are the snapshots in time of what a project contains
# container => it is a running instance of an image
# docker host => it is possible to have multiple containers in a single Docker host. When we refer to code or process running with Docker, 
it means they are running on the docker host.
